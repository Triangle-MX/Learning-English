                    <p class="color">A simple sentece contains one independent clause. What's an independent clause? It's one <span class="wow bounce different" data-wow-delay=".5s">subject</span> followed by one <span class="wow swing different-2" data-wow-delay=".5s">verb or phrase</span>. It expresses a single idea. <br><br> <span class="color-2">Examples of simple sentences:</span><br><span class="differento">I</span><span class="differento-2">'m happy.</span><br><span class="differento">Robert</span><span class="differento-2"> doesn't eat meat.</span><br><span class="differento">My brother and I</span><span class="differento-2"> went to the mall last night.</span><br><span class="differento">This new laptop computer</span><span class="differento-2"> has already crashed twice.</span><br><br>Notice that a "simple sentences" isn't necessarily short. The subject can be a single word like "I" or "Robert", or ot can be a double subject like "My Brother an I", or it can be multiple words describing a single person/object, like "This new laptop computer".</p>
